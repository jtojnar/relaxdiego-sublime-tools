Relaxdiego Sublime Tools
========================

 1. Open the terminal
 1. `cd` to your Sublime Text installation's `Packages/User` directory
 1. `git clone git://github.com/relaxdiego/relaxdiego-sublime-tools.git`
 1. Restart sublime

You should now be able to use "YAML to tmLanguage" in the Tools > Build System menu

NOTE: name your yml files `<File Name>.tmLanguage.yml` since the YAML to tmLanguage build system will look for and strip the trailing `.yml` extension
